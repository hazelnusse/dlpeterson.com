My bro [Brem](https://brndn.io/) recently updated his website to use Hugo.
I've been meaning to resurrect my defunct Pelican blog for a while, but after
putzing around with Pelican for a while I still hadn't made it happen. After
taking a look at Hugo, and playing with Brenden's blog as an example, I decided
to make the switch to Hugo. So far, so good.
