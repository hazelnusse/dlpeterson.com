Cassandra and I went to a composting and vermicomposting class at [Martial
Cottle
Park](https://www.sccgov.org/sites/parks/parkfinder/pages/martialcottle.aspx).
The park is 287 acres, and is about 7km from our house and is really beautiful.
It was gifted in 2003 by Walter Cottle Lester to the State and County for
development of a public park that informs and educates the public about the
agricultural heritage of the Santa Clara Valley. The class was free and we got
to take home several bags of organic compost; San Jose residents get a [pretty
good deal](https://www.sanjoseca.gov/index.aspx?NID=2191) on composters or worm
bins through the city of San Jose. We already have a [Greenes cedar
composter](https://greenesfence.com/collections/cedar-composter/products/cedar-wood-composter-rccomp)
to which we've been adding all our kitchen scraps, weeds, and garden trimmings,
but we'll probably be getting a worm bin and start keeping worms. We are in the
early stages of re-doing our yards with native plants, fruit trees, and raised
beds; we expect the worm bins to be helpful sometime early to mid 2020.

We learned a few things:

1. Breaking sticks/branches/twigs down with a chipper will accelerate the
   composting process. We are on the lookout for a used electric chipper now.
   They seem to range in price from $100-$200, and then a big jump to over
   $1000.
2. [BioBags](http://biobagusa.com/products/retail-products/food-scrap-products-retail/)
   are not practically compostable; we have discovered this the hard way and
   have a bunch of small pieces of thin green plastic spread throughout our
   back yard.  One of the instructors of the course indicated she saw these
   bags all over the place even in industrial hot composts and they tend to not
   break down. I don't know what ASTM D6400 defines to be "compostable", but
   whatever it is, it doesn't seem to translate to the real world.
3. Meat scraps are primarily discouraged due to their tendency to attract
   rodents but if you have a rodent secure compost bin or do post-hole
   composting, meat and fish scraps should be fine.
4. Feces from meat-eating animals (cats and dogs primarily) shouldn't be
   composted but feces from poultry or other vegetarian animals are fine. We
   already have 4 chickens and plan to raise meat rabbits, so we should have
   plenty of good stuff for the compost.

In taking this course I learned about the [University of California Agriculture
and Natural Resources (UCANR)](https://ucanr.edu/) and the [University of
California Cooperative Extension for Santa Clara
County](http://cesantaclara.ucanr.edu/). These are awesome resources I'll be
exploring in the near future. I learned about upcoming [2020 Master Composter
Training](http://cesantaclara.ucanr.edu/Home_Composting_Education/Master_Composter_Training_/)
which I may attend, depending on what is involved.
