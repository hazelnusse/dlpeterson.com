After reading that the [Pythonic Perambulations](http://jakevdp.github.io) site
had switch from Octopress to Pelican, I motivated myself to get my blog back up
and running. Until my VPS provider stopped providing VPS, I used to have a
Wordpress blog. I didn't spend the time to set it back up when I started
hosting my site on AWS, and had decided I didn't really want Wordpress anymore
and wanted something simpler but didn't really know what. Pelican seems like it
will be a good long term solution with minimal maintenance.

My TODO list for this site is:

* Make some static pages (about, contact, etc.).
* Decide on the organization of the menu bar.
* Decide how to organize content (date, topic, something else...).
* Decide on a title
* Figure out how Pelican plugins + themes work and install some.
* Social media plugins (G+, Twitter, Facebook)
* Commenting system plugin (Disqus, IntenseDebate, or Livefyre)
* IPython notebook plugin as showcased on Pythonic Perambulations
* Add all old Wordpress blog entries.
* Create a script to start a new article with all the basic field names
  inserted already.
